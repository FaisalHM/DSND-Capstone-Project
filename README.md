# DSND-Capstone-Project
This is the capstone project from Data Scientist Nanodegree, in this project, we will start by exploring the data frames provided from Strabucks and then clean them and merge them into one data frame to do some visualizations and create a model to predict the event type based on demographic data and other information.

## Installations <a name="installation"></a>
This project using python 3 and the following is the libraries tha are needed to be imported
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- math
- json
- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
- from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
- from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
- from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
- from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
- from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

## Project Motivation <a name="ProjectMotivation"></a>
In this project, I was intersetd in crating visulaizations that demonstrate the relationships between diffrent variables, and also to build a model to predict 
the type of event based on certin informations.


## File Descriptions <a name="FileDescriptions"></a>
- data
    - portfolio.json (original data)
    - profile.json (original data)
    - portfolio.json (original data)
- Starbucks_Capstone_notebook-zh.ipynb
